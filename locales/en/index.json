We are still looking forward to spending three even more intimate and intense days with you on our Bach Floor or in the newly designed Ambient and Chill Tent on the Wiese.

If you notice someone who is feeling bad, someone who is being discriminated against in any way, or if your or the boundaries of others are being disregarded, do not hesitate to act! If you feel unable to cope with a situation or need support, contact the Awareness Team (you will be informed of the Awareness Person's identification symbol on site) or a person with a radio. You do not have to tell anyone directly what has happened. Just say that you want to get in touch with the awareness team (or use our code word at the bar). You will find a safe space on the site where you can get help, information or simply withdraw if you wish. Important: The power of definition always lies with the person affected. People decide for themselves when and what form of violence or discrimination they have experienced. This definition is taken seriously, perceived as true and not questioned.\n\nOnly a yes means yes! Act according to this principle of consensus and make sure to always get the consent of those around you.Please do not draw conclusions about another person's gender identity based on their external appearance. Just because you read someone as male or female does not mean that person identifies as such.\n\nTo prevent discrimination in restrooms, all restrooms are unisex during our event. In general, we ask you to remember that regardless of how you read it, people can go to any restroom they feel is right for them.\n\nIf you take a photo/video of participants and want to post it, please ask for permission or make the faces unrecognizable. Not everyone wants to be seen on the internet.\n\nPlease also pay attention to others when it comes to consumption! The open consumption of illegal drugs is prohibited on the entire festival site! We all make mistakes.\n\nIf people use discriminatory language or ways of thinking, we try to make them aware of this through constructive criticism. We ask you to be open and listen when people offer you constructive criticism.\n\nThese guidelines apply to visitors, artists and employees. If you come to our event, we expect you to abide by our rules. All performing artists will be informed in advance about our guidelines for creating safe spaces and zero tolerance for incidents. We reserve the right to cancel contracts if we determine that an artist has violated our policies.\n\nIf you are new to this kind of awareness, please inform yourself before the festival or contact the awareness team on site. The team is also available for questions and information on the topic of Safe Use and can be contacted if you are interested."
